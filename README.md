A small extension to give dark theme for chromium pages.
You'll find instructions and packages [Here](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/25981/extension-23-03-20-dark-chrome-css-2-3?page=1).

Please note: I'm not actual a developer, but just a vivaldi community member. 

Use this at your own risk.

While is made for Vivaldi browser should actually work with most chromium browsers, Edge and Brave excluded perhaps, which have a more modified chromium user interface.
